# Bot Sample

To configure this sample, create a file in the root of the repo called `.env` with contents:

```ini
MICROSOFT_APP_ID = your_app_id
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD = your_app_password
```

Install dependencies by running `npm install` from this directory. This will also generate a build.

Finally, start the app by running `npm start`.

Use [Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator) to connect and chat with the sample bot.
